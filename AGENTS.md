A plugin marketplace of reusable skills, hooks, and project scaffolds for AI coding agents.

## Autonomy

Run as autonomously as possible by default. Do not ask for confirmation on routine actions — just do them. This includes file edits, running tests, creating branches, committing, and pushing. Only pause to ask when something is genuinely ambiguous or destructive beyond recovery. If the user wants more oversight, they'll say so.

## Versioning

Every change to a plugin **must** include a version bump in that plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Follow semver: patch for fixes, minor for new features or non-breaking changes, major for breaking changes. When a plugin also has `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, keep its version synchronized.

## Conventions

- Each plugin is self-contained under `plugins/`
- Skills follow the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) — `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
- Add a plugin to the Codex marketplace only when its complete workflow works in Codex; Claude-specific agents, hooks, and SDKs are not portable merely because the skill format is shared
- One plugin does one thing well
- Plugins can bundle skills, hooks, agents, and assets
- See existing plugins for schema examples

## Development

1. Create directory under `plugins/`
2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (name, description, version, author, license)
3. Add `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and/or hook configurations
4. Add entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
5. For Codex-compatible plugins, add `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and an entry to `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
6. Validate: `./validate-all.sh`
